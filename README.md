## Getting Started

After forking this repository you will need to then clone the repo locally and open up your index.html file in the browser.

Type 'open index.html' in your terminal and press enter (make sure you're in the right directory!). Your Cat Cards page should open in your browser. Alternatively, right click on your index.html file and select 'open with..' then select the browser of your choice (we recommend Google Chrome but any will do).

You should now see a collection of cute cat pictures and cat info. Yay.
